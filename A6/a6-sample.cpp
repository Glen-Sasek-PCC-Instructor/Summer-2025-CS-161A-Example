# Date:             April 1, 2022
# Description:      This program will present a menu to the user to calculate the total calories burned based on the type of workout.
This calculation uses the MET value (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) of each activity. We multiply the MET value with the person\'s body weight in kilograms. Then we multiply this with 0.0175 and the duration in minutes to calculate the calories burned in kcals.
# Input:            (What the program asks for, and data type, e.g., string)
# Output:           (Summary of messages displayed by the program)
# Sources:          Assignment 6 specifications
#                   and any other substantial aids, like web pages or students
#                   who helped you.
