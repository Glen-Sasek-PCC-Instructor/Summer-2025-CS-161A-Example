// A half-life is the amount of time it takes for a substance or entity to fall to half its original value. Caffeine has a half-life of about 6 hours in humans. Given caffeine amount (in mg) as input, output the caffeine level after 6, 12, and 24 hours.

// Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing
// cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements.

// Ex: If the input is:

// 100
// the output is:

// After 6 hours: 50.00 mg
// After 12 hours: 25.00 mg
// After 24 hours: 6.25 mg
// Note: A cup of coffee has about 100 mg. A soda has about 40 mg. An "energy" drink (a misnomer) has between 100 mg and 200 mg.

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>   //For setprecision
using namespace std;

// Compile and Test
// g++ zybooks-lab-2-19.cpp && ./a.out < <(echo "100") && rm ./a.out

int main() {
   double caffeineMg;  // "double" supports floating-point like 75.5, versus int for integers like 75.
   
   cin >> caffeineMg;
   cout << fixed << setprecision(2);   // All later cout's will print floating-point values to exactly 2 decimal places.
                                       // Ex: 3.60
   /* Type your code here. */
   cout << "After 6 hours: " << (caffeineMg / 2.0) << " mg" << endl;

   //cout << "After 18 hours: " << (caffeineMg / (2.0 * 2.0 * 2.0)) << " mg" << endl;
   cout << "After 24 hours: " << (caffeineMg / (2.0 * 2.0 * 2.0 * 2.0)) << " mg" << endl;
